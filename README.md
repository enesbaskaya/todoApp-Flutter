# todo_app

An application where you can easily keep your to-do list. You can use it by logging in with an e-mail address or Google. The Firebase connection file 'google.json' should be added.

Don't forget to run pubget for file 'pubspec.yaml'.

The packages I use are;
- cloud_firestore
- firebase_auth
- firebase_core
- sign_button
- fluttertoast
- google_sign_in
